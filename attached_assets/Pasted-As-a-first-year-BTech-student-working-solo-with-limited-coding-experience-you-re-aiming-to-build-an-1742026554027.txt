As a first-year BTech student working solo with limited coding experience, you're aiming to build an initial prototype of the Quantum-Resistant Zero Trust AI Security System to impress Infosys. You've requested specific enhancements: integration with real biometric data collection, advanced quantum-resistant cryptography visualization, multiple anomaly detection algorithms for comparison, and an expanded threat intelligence dashboard. Since you're collaborating with Replit AI for coding support, I'll provide a detailed plan to build this initial prototype, keeping it manageable within your two-day timeline while ensuring it's impactful and bug-free. I'll also tailor the approach to your skill level, focusing on simplicity, and provide clear guidance for each component.
Overview of the Initial Prototype
We’re building an enhanced version of the Quantum-Resistant Zero Trust AI Security System with the following components:  
Zero Trust Prototype with Real Biometric Data Integration: A system that collects real typing speed data (we’ll use a simplified method since you don’t have access to advanced hardware), detects anomalies using multiple algorithms, and triggers a response.  
Advanced Quantum-Resistant Cryptography Visualization: A detailed visual representation of lattice-based cryptography compared to RSA under quantum attack.  
Multiple Anomaly Detection Algorithms Comparison: We’ll implement and compare Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM to detect anomalies in user behavior.  
Expanded Threat Intelligence Dashboard: A mock dashboard with additional data points (e.g., quantum computing progress, global cyber threats).  
“Wow Factor” Video: A short animation showing RSA breaking and lattice-based cryptography rising (already planned, but we’ll refine it).
Since you’re a beginner, I’ll simplify the implementation while ensuring it’s impressive. We’ll use Replit as your coding environment, and I’ll provide a detailed prompt for Replit AI to generate the code. Let’s break this down into a masterplan for the initial prototype.
Masterplan: Building the Initial Prototype
Step 1: Define the Scope for a First-Year Student
Given your limited coding experience and two-day timeline, we’ll balance ambition with feasibility:  
Real Biometric Data Collection: Collecting real biometric data (e.g., typing speed) typically requires hardware or APIs (like mouse tracking or webcam access), which can be complex. Instead, we’ll simulate a real-time typing speed collector by having you type into the app, measuring your keystrokes per second. This keeps it simple but feels “real.”  
Multiple Anomaly Detection Algorithms: We’ll use Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM—both beginner-friendly with scikit-learn—and compare their performance visually.  
Advanced Quantum-Resistant Visualization: We’ll enhance the lattice-based cryptography visual with a side-by-side comparison to RSA, using simple graphs.  
Expanded Threat Intelligence Dashboard: We’ll create a static dashboard (no backend needed) with mock data on quantum progress and global threats.
Step 2: Tools and Setup
Environment: Use Replit (since you’re already using Replit AI).  
Libraries:  
numpy, pandas for data handling.  
scikit-learn for anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM).  
tkinter for the GUI (simpler than Flask for beginners).  
matplotlib for visualizations and the “Wow Factor” video.
No Advanced Hardware: We’ll simulate real-time typing speed collection within the app.  
Install Libraries in Replit:
In Replit, go to the shell and run:  
bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python.
Step 3: Detailed Prompt for Replit AI
Here’s the prompt you can use to generate the initial prototype code in Replit AI. It’s detailed, beginner-friendly, and ensures all components are included with error handling.
I am a first-year BTech student with limited coding experience, working solo on a project to impress Infosys with a cybersecurity prototype called the "Quantum-Resistant Zero Trust AI Security System." I need your help to build an initial prototype in Python within two days, using Replit as my coding environment. The prototype must be functional, bug-free, and visually impressive, with all components working seamlessly for a live demo and presentation. I’m relying on you to generate all the code, including detailed comments, error handling, and test instructions, while keeping it simple enough for a beginner to understand and execute. Here’s what I need:

### Project Overview

     - Simulate mouse movement data (since I don’t have hardware access).
     - Use two anomaly detection algorithms (Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM) to detect suspicious behavior, and compare their results.
     - Display results in a GUI with a response mechanism (e.g., alert for anomalies).
  2. **Advanced Quantum-Resistant Cryptography Visualization:**
     - Create a side-by-side graph comparing RSA encryption strength (drops to 0 under quantum attack) and lattice-based cryptography (stays at 100).
